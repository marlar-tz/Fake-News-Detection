## My process

### Built with
- Fake News Detection model
  - Logistic Regression Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
  - Passive Aggressive Classifier
- Fake News Detection website
  - Flask framework
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - AJAX

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use the Flask framework to integrate a machine learning model into a web application. Moreover, I also learned about AJAX, which allows sending and receiving data between the web page and the server asynchronously.

### How to run the web app

To run the web app, enter python app.py in the terminal.
